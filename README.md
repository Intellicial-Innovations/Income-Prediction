# Income-Prediction

In this project, we will use a number of different supervised algorithms to precisely predict individualsâ€™ income using Adult data Set collected from the UCI machine learning repository. We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Our goal with this implementation is to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

Prediction
Some of the available Classification algorithms in scikit-learn:

> Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
>> Decision Trees
>>> Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost, Random Forest,..)
>>>> Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
>>>>> Logistic Regression

What we will be using in our notebook are
> Logistic Regression
>> Decission Trees
